# VR Utility Modules
This repository contains a few utility modules for VR
* Simple linear algebra library
* Simple 360 video player that runs on oculus rift DK2

It will be very difficult to run this project again, as lot of libraries used here is outdated. But concept and codes from this project will be usable elsewhere.
